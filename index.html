     We do not track your location.<br>
     We do not require a user account unless explicitly added later.</p>

  <h2>2. Local Storage</h2>
  <p>Most user data is stored locally on your device and not automatically uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly choose to sync or backup (if such feature exists).</p>

  <ul>
    <li>service providers (e.g., cloud storage)</li>
    <li>where required by law</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers must comply with privacy rules.</p>
